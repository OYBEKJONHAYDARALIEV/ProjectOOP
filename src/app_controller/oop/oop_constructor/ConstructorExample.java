        // constructor is special method

        // why we need to use constructor ?


        // Types of constructor  are 3 :

        // 1. Default constructor -> standard, no need to write because it has already written by JAVA

        // 2. No - parametrized constructor -> has written by developer without any parametres

        // 3. Parametrized constructor -> has written by developer with any parametres
